<h2 id="toc_hurry">For those in a hurry</h2>

<p>If you don’t feel like reading this manual and just want to start playing, please note the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be careful when placing your first unit on the map. You can only place the following units directly adjacent to your own unit (not diagonally) that is already on the map. Avoid islands and winding coastal regions!</li>

<li>To begin with, place all units on plants of the same variety if possible.</li>

<li>To begin with, adjust your species’ adaptation to the food that is most common in your distribution area to at least 50%.</li>

<li>Eat as much as possible, at least enough to get a full row of leaves. Otherwise some of your units will starve. You eat by clicking on your individual or by pressing the space bar.</li>

<li>If you are in a hopeless situation (e.g. “fenced” by mountains and obstacles) you can commit “suicide”. To do this, right-click on your individual or press Escape.</li>

<li>If your species is going extinct, you’re doing something wrong. Maybe you should read the instructions!</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="toc_story">How it all began</h2>

<p>”Good morning, Commander.”</p>

<p>James T. Quirk, commander of the Charles Darwin space station, stretched. “Uaaah! Man, I slept well.” He climbed out of the cryo tank, trying to massage the blood into his toes, which were still cooled to plus 3 degrees Celcius. “Stardate?”, he asked the on-board computer.</p>

<p>“Quarter past 2486:2034-456-91”</p>

<p>“Whaaaaat?” Quirk almost fell into his cryo tank again. “I overslept?” He gasped in disbelief. “Fifty million years???”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the on-board computer had neither humour nor imagination (to be on the safe side, Quirk had removed those modules shortly after the “Charles Darwin” started). So it wasn’t a joke. “Why didn’t you wake me up, you… you general protection fault?” he roared.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Commander. I just didn’t look at the clock,” said the computer in an offended voice.</p>

<p>Quirk wished back in the early days of silicon, when computers made cryptic error messages instead of lazy excuses. Finally he shrugged resignedly. “Ah, whatever. How are the amino acids on Q-POP? ”</p>

<p>“Something is going on!” Said the on-board computer, visibly delighted to be able to change the subject. “Have a look…”</p>

<p>Fascinated, Quirk leaned over the holoprojector, which created a lifelike, spatial image of the planet’s surface. Indeed, something happened. The amino acids had apparently developed into highly complex beings that swarmed in large numbers through a strange landscape.</p>

<p>Quirk paused. How could it be that in such a short time—fifty million years were not even a wink in context of evolution—sophisticated life forms had been formed from a few amino acids? With logarithmicly growing displeasure, he realized that he had slept through one of the greatest scientific sensations since the invention of the Perpetuum Mobile. He could have been the first person to witness the decisive step from inorganic matter to living organisms. If only he hadn’t forgotten to set the alarm clock after dinner last night!</p>

<p>Dinner—the memory of his last meal before cryosleep, which was supposed to last only ten thousand years, was slowly coming back, warning him that he hadn’t eaten for eons. The starter had delicious salmon pate with fine lizard tongues, followed by beef steak with mushroom sauce and mixed poultry beetle larvae salad. For dessert he had had green jelly and strawberries. Then he had cleaned up and, instead of washing dishes, had thrown away the dirty dishes through the vacuum waste lock. Quirk realized that he had violated space regulations.</p>

<p>And suddenly a terrible premonition sprouted in him. Let’s see what happened to it, he thought sarcastically, when he set the holoprojector to maximum magnification…</p>

<h2 id="toc_welcome">Welcome to Q-Pop</h2>

<p>Welcome to the eternal cycle of life and survival, eating and being eaten. Take part in nature’s tireless pursuit of creating ever more sophisticated, perfect and arrogant organisms.</p>

<p>Your task is to lead one of six different types of herbivorous species in their fight for survival. You have to collect food, defend your pastures against unpleasant competitors, beware of carnivores and also take care to create offspring. The better you do this, the more your species can spread across the planet and adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions.</p>

<p>Q-POP is a simulation game. That means: It tries to depict real relationships in a simplified model. In fact, we have tried to take into account the most important relationships and laws of evolution: In Q-POP, the most successful is the species that best adapts to the prevailing environmental conditions. The decisive factor here is the spread of certain plant species, which in turn depends on the prevailing climate. Disasters such as meteorite strikes, volcanic activity or devastating earthquakes can suddenly change the situation and suddenly push back a dominant species or even cause it to become extinct.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Q-POP is primarily a game and not an experiment kit for biology students. Our primary goal in game development was to have fun with your friends or alone against multiple computer opponents. That’s why we left out everything that we thought was unimportant or obstructive to the fun of the game, and maybe presented some things that were not entirely scientifically correct. But after all, Q-POP also plays on a distant planet. And which biology professor really knows what the love life of the amoeba looks like or how a bouncing strawberry behaves while fleeing from a carnivorous mushroom?</p>

<h2 id="toc_overview">The game at a glance</h2>

<p>Q-POP can be played by up to six players on a single PC. Missing players are replaced by computer opponents whose skill level is variable. Each player initially selects one of six herbivorous species and places some individuals on the world map that shows the main continent on an alien planet. Six different plant species grow in the different regions, which serve as food for the herbivores.</p>

<p>How well a species can survive in a given area depends largely on how well it is adapted to the food found there. This is determined by the traits ​​of the species, which each player can set at the beginning and later improve through evolution. In addition to adapting to the six plant species, there are other characteristics such as intelligence, combat strength and reproduction rate that are generally useful in the struggle for survival. As the game progresses, each player receives evolution points that they can use to improve these traits. The player with most evolution points wins the game.</p>

<p>Each turn is divided into the phases “survival”, “reproduction”, “catastrophes”, “evaluation” and “development”. In the survival phase, a single individual, as a representative of its kind, is exposed to the struggle for survival. The player controls this individual through an alien landscape in search of food and females willing to mate, being careful of carnivores and other dangers. The more food the individual collects during the survival phase and the more often it mates, the more offspring the player can then distribute on the world map in the reproduction phase. There will always be conflicts with the other herbivores about the limited space. Usually, such conflicts are won by the species that is better adapted to the terrain.</p>

<p>After each player has placed the offspring, catastrophes can occur that sometimes depopulate entire areas and mostly have a lasting effect on the climate and thus the spread of the various plant species. The palette ranges from meteorite strikes to the landing of humans who, constantly hunting for experimental animals, make survival even more difficult.</p>

<p>After possible disasters, the evolution points are distributed in the evaluation phase, according to the order of the distribution of the species: the species with the most individuals gets the most evolution points, and so on. The evolution points can be used in the development phase to determine the traits of the species, and thereby improving their ability to survive. Then this survivability is tested again in the survival phase and so on. After reaching a predetermined number of turns, the player who has collected the most evolution points during the game wins.</p>

<p>But enough theory; let’s go!</p>

<h2 id="toc_start">Start of the game</h2>

<p>After the intro animation, which you can end at any time with a mouse click, you first get to the player selection screen. Clicking on the images next to the image of the species determines whether it should be played by a human player or by the computer. It is also possible to switch off individual species; however, this is generally not advisable since the game is the most interesting and exciting with six different species. (Particularly cautious players can also play all by themselves without an opponent.) The individual species only differ in appearance.</p>

<figure>
<img src="init_en.png" alt="Screenshot of the player selection screen">
</figure>

<p>For each species, the “intelligence quotient” can be set to one of four levels by clicking on the corresponding light bulb symbol, “Charles Darwin” being the highest and “Darwin’s dog” the lowest. For a human player, a high IQ means a high level of difficulty in the game. For computer opponents, a high IQ means a high level of skill. So when all six species are set to maximum IQ, the game is most difficult for the human player(s).</p>

<p>If you had already saved a game earlier, you can continue the game by clicking on the “Load game” button.</p>

<p>At the top of the game there are some buttons that are available throughout the game: The info box in the left corner opens information about the game. The language button changes the language of the game. Music and sound effects can be switched on or off via two buttons in the right corner, provided the game was not started completely without sound. The gear button opens an options menu where settings can be changed.</p>

<p>When you have made all the settings, click on “Continue”. A window will then appear asking for the duration of the game in turns. The “Short” setting is useful for getting to know the game. “Medium” corresponds to an evening of playing with friends (approx. 3-5 minutes of playing time per human player and turn). “Long” is recommended if you are playing alone against the computer or if you want to continue the game over several sessions. For the really enduring players, there is the option “To the bitter end”. With this setting, the game only ends when all but one of the species are extinct or no human player survives.</p>

<h2 id="toc_startworld">World map</h2>

<p>To begin with, each player must place 10 units of their species on the world map. The map shows an overview of the main continent of the foreign planet with its land masses, mountains and plants. There are six different plant species:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Blueleaf</b> (light blue flowers, grows in cool, moist regions)</li>

<li><b>Stinkballs</b> (green balls on stems, like dry, cold areas)</li>

<li><b>Rangones</b> (orange, round fruits, grow in temperate zones)</li>

<li><b>Firegrass</b> (dark red grass, grows on dry soil)</li>

<li><b>Hushrooms</b> (purple mushrooms, growing in damp, warm areas)</li>

<li><b>Snakeroot</b> (dark blue flowers, prefers warm regions of medium humidity)</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="world_en.png" alt="Screenshot of the world map">
</figure>

<p>Since the continent is located in the northern hemisphere of the planet, it is cooler in the north (at the top of the map) than in the south, which is why blueleaf and stink balls prefer to grow there. It is particularly humid in the lowlands along the coasts and on the coast of inland lakes (blue fields). Around the mountains, it is rather dry.</p>

<p>The current status of the global climate can be read on the right section of the screen in the measuring cup (humidity) and thermometer (average temperature). These values ​​change over the course of the game and affect the spread of different plant species. In addition, the current player and the turn number (calendar) are visible in the upper area. Below this, the current number of the six species is displayed relative to each other. The symbols of your own species indicate how many new units you can place on the map. At the beginning each player can set up 10 units.</p>

<p>The current player places the first individual by simply clicking on the map (sea and mountain fields as well as coastal fields cannot be occupied). Special attention is required: If the first unit is placed, further units can only be placed on fields that directly (not diagonally) border on fields occupied by your own species. This also applies to all subsequent turns. The placement of the first unit thus determines the region in which your own species develops at the start of the game.</p>

<p>When choosing the starting region, the following should be taken into account.</p>

<ul>
<li>As the sea level fluctuates, it is dangerous to place all units in coastal regions. Otherwise you could easily become the victim of a flood.</li>

<li>Make sure you have as much freedom of movement as possible: inlets, lakes and mountains can severely limit the spread of your own species.</li>

<li>It makes sense to initially occupy fields with a certain type of food and then to adapt your own species to this type of food (see next section). The specialization can later be extended to other types of food.</li>

<li>At the beginning, you should keep as much distance as possible from your neighbours and postpone strenuous wrangling around pastures for as late as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>When all individuals are placed, the next player is activated by clicking the “Continue” button.</p>

<h2 id="toc_traits">Traits</h2>

<p>After all players have placed their first individuals on the map, it is time to determine the characteristics of their own species. This happens on the development screen. It shows the 13 traits ​​of the species.</p>

<figure>
<img src="mutation_en.png" alt="Screenshot of the traits">
</figure>

<ul>
<li><b>Adaptation</b> to the six different types of food is particularly important. It indicates how well a species can utilize the respective food. When fighting with other players, it is often crucial how well both species are adapted to the food in the disputed field. Those who are not adequately adapted to the food in their distribution area risk a rapid extinction of their kind due to starvation. At the beginning you should set the adaptation to the most common plant species in your own distribution area to a value of at least 40-50.</li>

<li><b>The reproduction rate</b> of a species indicates how quickly it can reproduce and spread. A high reproduction rate increases the effect of food collection and mating in the survival phase and enables a faster spread of the own species.</li>

<li><b>The attack and defence strength</b> of a species is particularly important when fighting for pasture. Species with a high attack strength can even particularly well displace competitors adapted to the conditions there. Conversely, the defensive strength helps to maintain its terrain against intruders. A high level of defence can also be helpful in the fight against carnivores.</li>

<li><b>Camouflage</b> is very useful to avoid carnivores during the survival phase. This way, a species can collect more food and reproduce better.</li>

<li><b>The speed</b> of a species is also helpful in escaping carnivores. In addition, a high speed value enables you to move more efficiently on the world map and thus, for example, react more flexibly to climate shifts.</li>

<li><b>The sensory organs</b> of a species facilitate orientation in the survival phase. The better senses a species has, the more likely it will be to avoid enemies, to find females that are willing to mate, and to find particularly productive sources of food.</li>

<li><b>Intelligence</b> is a kind of “all-round ability” that makes survival easier in a variety of subtle ways. It increases the chances of conflicts with other races (albeit to a lesser extent than the “attack” and “defence” traits), makes it easier to avoid predators and improves orientation in the survival phase. This value has absolutely nothing to do with the “IQ” that you set when starting the game to determine the level of difficulty of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the beginning, all traits ​​are set to 10% (the higher the percentage value, the better the respective trait). Each player has a number of “evolution points”, which are shown in the blue bar at the top. You can distribute these points by clicking on the “+” button next to the respective trait or on the right area of ​​the bar (step of 10). If you want to cancel the increase in a trait, you can do so by clicking on the “-” Button or the left bar area. However, you cannot use this to reduce a trait beyond the preset initial value.</p>

<p>Distribute the evolution points at your own discretion. Above all, think of an adequate adaptation to the food species prevailing in your area on the world map! When you are finished, click “Continue”. Since undistributed evolution points expire at the end of a turn, you should always distribute all points before ending your turn.</p>

<h2 id="toc_survival">The survival phase</h2>

<p>Now it gets serious (well, not toooo serious). You are entering the crucial phase of survival for the first time. Now it will show whether your species is really up to the struggle for survival.</p>

<figure>
<img src="survival_en.png" alt="Screenshot of the survival phase">
</figure>

<p>Most of the screen shows the immediate environment of your individual, chosen as a representative of its kind to represent the entire species in the struggle for survival. Obstacles (mountains, trees, boiling swamps, etc.), food, other herbivores, females willing to mate and carnivores can be found in the area. In addition, the planet surface also harbours one or the other, mostly unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p>The environment your individual is in depends on where your species is represented on the world map. For example, if you have occupied many fields with rangons (orange fruits), you will find this form of food very often. If you have occupied high-lying terrain near mountains, you will find a corresponding number of volcanoes and mountains in your area, and so on. The distribution of food competitors (other herbivores), carnivores and mating species also depends on the distribution of your species on the map. You will find the neighbours on the border of your territory particularly often. The larger the area you occupy on the world map, the more carnivores appear, because these naturally specialize in the most numerous herbivores. The denser your species is distributed, the more mating partners you will find, but the poorer the food supply will be. So if your individuals are scattered across the map in small groups, the chances of reproduction are less, but you will find a more extensive range of food. Last but not least, difficulty level (IQ) also influences these factors.</p>

<p>On the right section of the screen, there are some important indicators of survival. Above you see a kind of “radar screen” that gives you information about the wider area. Green leaves on it symbolize particularly rich food sources, skull symbols stand for carnivores, hearts for mating partners and blue, grim faces for other herbivores. The player is marked with a yellow cross in the middle. The better the perception (eyes, ears, sense of smell etc.) Of your species is developed, the wider the radius of this “radar” is, so the better you can orientate yourself in your environment.</p>

<p>The step indicator (blue bar) and the time indicator (red bar) are located under the radar screen. The step indicator shows how many moves you can make in the current survival phase. It gets a bit shorter with every movement or eating process (depending on the IQ you have about 50 to 80 moves per survival phase). When you run out of steps, your survival phase is over and it is the next player’s turn. The red time indicator shows how much time you have left to consider your next step. If you do nothing before the bar expires, your individual will simply stand idle on the spot or eat if it stands on food. So you are under a certain time pressure (you have about 3 seconds to consider each move). The time begins to run out as soon as you click the mouse in the viewing window or press an arrow key or the space bar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>HINT</b>
<br>If you want to take a break during your survival phase, for example, because the phone is ringing, you can pause the game by clicking on the “info button” at the top left or the “option button” at the top right. The time is then “stopped”. If you want to continue playing, just click the button again. Alternatively, you can press the “P” button. In this case, the music will also be paused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can easily control your individual with the mouse or the arrow keys. If you click anywhere on the surrounding area, the individual will try to move in this direction (you can only move straight, not diagonally). If you click directly on the individual, it stops in place and tries to eat something if there is food. Likewise, the four cursor keys move the individual in the corresponding direction. Use the space bar to eat if possible.</p>

<p>Your goal in the survival phase is to eat as much as possible, mate as often as possible and die as rarely as possible. “Rarely die” because your survival phase does not end automatically if you are eaten or fall victim to another danger. Instead, you will receive a “skull” that is displayed on the right section of the screen. Skulls cause some of your individuals to die on the world map, so you should avoid dangers as far as possible.</p>

<p>If you find food and click the individual or press the space bar, your individual eats and receives leaf symbols for this, which are displayed on the right edge of the image. How many leaves you get depends on how well you are adapted to the food. So it may be that you have to eat several times to get a leaf symbol. You should try to collect at least 20 leaf symbols (a complete series). This is the amount of food required to provide all of your individuals with sufficient food. If you collect less, some of your individuals on the world map may starve. Collect more, and the birth rate increases. Note that you can eat more than once in most food fields!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>HINT</b>
<br>
There is a special “power food”, which is very rare. Try to eat it and finally give the dinosaurs and mushrooms a treat!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you see a female ready to mate nearby, you should try to approach her. As soon as you move to an adjacent square, the mating begins and you receive a heart symbol. The more heart symbols you can collect, the more new individuals you can place on the world map in the next propagation phase. You can only mate once with each female.</p>

<p>If you see other herbivores nearby and move to an adjacent field, you can drive them out of your territory. There is a fight that you will always win and thereby get a symbol of the respective defeated species. The fight has no direct impact on the world map, but the “combat experience” will give you extra strength in the next propagation phase if you have to deal with your neighbours. But keep in mind that such territorial fights cost time that you need for foraging or mating.</p>

<p>Their biggest enemy in the survival phase are the carnivores. Try to avoid them by spotting them in good time (watch your “radar”!). Once a carnivore has picked up your trail, it is often difficult to shake off. If you have high camouflage and speed traits, there is a chance that the carnivore will lose sight of you and stop following you. The collected food and mating symbols are retained even if your individual is eaten (which can happen several times in a survival phase). If your species has a very high defence value, you may be lucky enough to emerge victorious from a confrontation with a carnivore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>HINT</b>
<br>If a carnivore is hot on your heels, you may consider to submit to your fate and let yourself be eaten. Otherwise you may waste too much time with an unnecessary escape. So avoid carnivores as early as possible! Carnivores can only see you as long as they are in the main window. Outside the window (only on “radar”), they do not pose any immediate danger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your individual gets eaten or otherwise dies, you start over at another place. Should you ever find yourself in a hopeless situation, for example, because all ways out are blocked by obstacles, you can also commit “suicide” by right-clicking on your individual or pressing the escape key. After confirming the security question you will receive a skull and will be “teleported” to a random field.</p>

<p>If you want, you can prematurely terminate your survival phase by pressing the Continue button. However, this is normally not sensible and is only intended for the case that a player is “no longer in the mood” and leaves the game. After confirming the security question, it is the next player’s turn.</p>

<p>Should your species die out, for example, because you haven’t found enough food and all the individuals are starved, don’t take it tragically. The mighty dinosaurs fared no better, and the so-called “intelligent” inhabitants of planet Earth are already trying hard to achieve this even faster and more thoroughly.</p>

<h2 id="toc_propagation">The propagation phase</h2>

<p>At the end of the survival phase, there may be a fewer individuals of your species on the map. To compensate, you hopefully have produced plenty of offspring, which is represented by small, coloured images of your species on the right section of the screen. You can now distribute these individuals. This works the same way as for the starting line-up, with two important differences: You can now only place individuals adjacent to existing own individuals. And you can now also try to conquer fields occupied by other species.</p>

<p>When you place a individual on a field where there already is an enemy individual, a fight starts. You cannot directly influence the course of the fight. As a result, either the opposing unit is removed from the game and you have conquered the field, or the attempt has failed and your attacking individual has been lost. How the fight turns out depends crucially on how well you and your opponent’s species are adapted to the type of food in the competitive field. Added to this are your attack strength and the opponent’s defence strength, as well as modifications by the respective intelligence and the combat experience gained in the last phase of survival. Luck also plays a small role. You can attack the same field several times, but each time, you risk the life of one of your individuals.</p>

<p>In addition to placing the offspring, you can also move units in the propagation phase. How many movement points you have depends on the speed of your species and is marked by black shadows on the right screen section. Each time you click on an individual on the map, it is removed from the map and placed in the offspring pool while one of the shadow symbols disappears. You can then place the individual anywhere on the map next to your own unit there. In this way, real migrations are possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>HINT</b>
<br>To make it easier to see which plant species is growing in a field occupied by a unit, you can right-click on it. The individual on the field disappears as long as you hold down the right mouse button and then returns. Alternatively, you can also click on the avatar below the calendar. As long as you keep the mouse button pressed, all individuals will be shown semitransparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to end your turn, click on “Continue”. If you have not yet used up all of the propagation and movement points, you will be asked to confirm this. Under no circumstances should you refrain from placing new units on the map, as these cannot be “saved” will disappear. However, it can happen that your spreading is blocked by water or mountains</p>

<h2 id="toc_disasters">Disasters</h2>

<p>Disasters have repeatedly caused sudden changes in the development of living things in the history of Earth and often led to the extinction of many species. They should therefore not be missing in a simulation game on the subject of evolution. In Q-POP, disasters mean that the game can experience a surprising turn even when a player believes himself the winner.</p>

<p>Disasters occur in every turn at the end of the propagation phase. There are nine different disasters with very different effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hot period:</b> The continent is moved closer to the equator by shifting the planet axis. This increases the mean temperature and changes in ocean currents mean that less rain falls while the sea level drops. As a consequence, plants like rangons and firegrass that love warmth and dryness will spread. Other plants are being pushed back. At the same time, however, new, moist coastlines emerge from the receding sea, and islands are suddenly connected to the mainland by land bridges.</li>

<li><b>Cold period:</b> Here, too, changes in the rotation of the planet cause climate change, but with the opposite sign as in the hot period. In contrast to the hot period, the cold period has no effect on sea level. The cold favours the “northern” plants blueleaf and stink balls.</li>

<li><b>Flooding:</b> The global climate has warmed up due to stronger solar activity or volcanic eruptions and the associated “greenhouse effect”. As a result, the polar ice caps melt, the sea level rises sharply and floods low lying coastal regions. Plants that love moisture and cold are pushed back. Individuals on flooded areas die. It may happen that individual areas are separated from the mainland, so that species on them may not be able to spread. Keeping your species away from coastal areas can reduce your risk of flooding.</li>

<li><b>Earthquake:</b> Dramatic tectonic shifts have repeatedly changed the face of the earth in a short time–archaeologically speaking. In Q-POP, the appearance of the continent changes significantly: mountains are formed where there used to be valleys, and vice versa. Beings who stand on fields that become mountains or lakes die. The earthquakes have no impact on the climate and sea level.</li>

<li><b>Volcanic eruption:</b> Huge volcanic eruptions destroy all life in the immediately adjacent fields. Volcanoes can only erupt in mountain fields. So you can reduce the risk by keeping your species away from mountains.</li>

<li><b>Meteor impact:</b> The destructive force is even stronger when a large meteorite hits the planet. Such an event is believed to be responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs and countless other animal and plant species 65 million years ago on Earth. The effects are indeed dramatic: the immediate vicinity of the impact site is being devastated; a huge crater emerges, lined with newly raised massifs. Due to the impact, millions of tons of dust are blown into the stratosphere and darken the sky for decades. The sun’s rays decrease and the global climate cools down considerably. The polar ice caps expand and bind more water so that the sea level drops. As a result, the cold and moisture-loving plants are favoured.</li>

<li><b>Cosmic radiation:</b> Increased occurrence of cosmic radiation (symbolized in the game by the animation of a glowing meteorite) changes all species by mutation. As a result, the traits ​​of each species change dramatically. Specifically, this means that the values ​​of your different traits are randomly exchanged with each other. In this way, nothing changes in the overall level of development of your species, but it can happen that your species e.g. is suddenly adapted to a completely different diet than the one you previously specialized in. In the next development phase, pay attention to how your species has changed! You can reduce the effects of cosmic rays by not concentrating too much on a few traits, but by evenly distributing your evolution points.</li>

<li><b>Plague:</b> A new, puzzling disease appears in a specific area of ​​the map, affecting all species in that area. Every individual in the area where the disease occurs has a certain chance of surviving the disease. You can limit the risk of an epidemic regionally by spreading your individuals across the continent.</li>

<li><b>Humans:</b> Perhaps the most serious disaster in Q-POP is the arrival of humans. In their tireless efforts to help endangered nature, they build a research station on the planet and hunt for experimental animals to study the nature of Q-POP, to be shipped to zoos and thus “save them from extinction”. There is now an additional threat in the survival phase. Humans behave like carnivores, but are more difficult to shake off than the natural enemies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_evaluation">The evaluation phase</h2>

<p>At the end of the propagation phase, evolution points are distributed. The species with the most individuals on the world map receives most evolution points. The number of evolution points also depends on the number of players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>HINT</b>
<br>
Since the distributed evolution points depend on the ranking of the players and not linearly on the number of individuals on the map, a single unit can decide about victory or loss. It is therefore sometimes worthwhile to attack a slightly stronger opponent in the propagation phase, in order to have more units on the world map in the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number of evolution points distributed in this turn is added to the total trait values ​​of each species and results in the total number of points of each species. The ranking of the species is shown on the evaluation screen based on this total number of points. Under each column are the current number of individuals (displayed next to a symbol of the respective species), the evolution points obtained in this turn (next to a DNA double helix) and the total points (next to a wreath). The species on the highest pillar represents the currently most developed species. In the last turn, this species is also the winner of the entire game.</p>

<p>The evaluation phase is the only opportunity to save the game or load an old game. Q-POP also automatically saves the game status in the browser every turn. If something goes wrong in a turn, you can always return to the last turn.</p>

<p>After the evaluation phase, a new turn begins with the development phase. Now you can improve the traits of your species with the evolution points you just obtained by clicking the corresponding “+” buttons or the right part of the bar. To undo distributed evolution points, click the corresponding “-” button or the left part of the bar. However, you cannot reduce the traits below the original value. When you are finished, click “Continue”. When all players have distributed their evolution points, the next phase of survival, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="toc_ending">The ending</h2>

<p>Depending on the pre-determined goal of the game, the game ends after a specified number of turns, when all but one species have died out or when there are no human players left. If the specified number of turns is reached, the game ends after the evaluation phase. A video will show how the winning species has become the dominant species on the planet Q-POP.</p>

<h2 id="toc_audio">Music and sound output</h2>

<p>If the game is called up with the option “?audio=no” in the address bar, the sound is switched off completely and no sound files are loaded. This can shorten the loading time, but the sound can then no longer be started. If you still want to play with sound, you can save the game and reload the page (this time without the “?audio=no” option) and load the saved game.</p>

<h2 id="toc_errors">If it does not work</h2>

<p>If you find bugs in the game or have any suggestions for improvement, please send me an email to qpop at frunit.de or open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/Frunit/qpop.js/issues">github.com/Frunit/qpop.js</a>. Any kind of constructive criticism is welcome!</p>

<p>If the game should suddenly freeze, please open the browser console (mostly via F12). Copy the error message in the window and send it together with a description of what happened to qpop at frunit.de. Alternatively, you can also create an issue at <a href="https://github.com/Frunit/qpop.js/issues">github.com/Frunit/qpop.js</a>. In any case, it is also important to know which browser and operating system you are using.</p>

<p>The remake was created just for fun. Copying the game was approved by Karl L. von Wendt and Lars Hammer. It is very difficult to run the original game on modern computers. The goal was to create a game that is a precise copy of the original game, but playable in any modern browser.</p>

<p>The source code of the remake is freely available at <a href="https://github.com/Frunit/qpop.js">github.com/Frunit/qpop.js</a>. The graphics are <i>not</i> freely available!</p>
