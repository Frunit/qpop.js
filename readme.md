Q-POP
=====

The game **Q-POP** was published in 1995 by *von Wendt Konzept GmbH* in Germany. It was only published in German, although an unfinished English version exists. The sparse resources you can find on the net will mostly be in German as for example my fan page [frunit.de/qpop](https://www.frunit.de/qpop) and the [Fandom Wiki](https://qpop.fandom.com/de) (feel free to start an English version!).

As an exercise in Javascript programming and in reverse engineering, I am trying to reimplement the game in Javascript to make it accessible to anyone with a modern browser. I will try to do this in vanilla Javascript without any frameworks or other external dependencies.

Furthermore, I will try to stick to the original game as closely as possible except for some convenience functionality. Known differences to the original game are documented [here](differences.md). A long-term goal is to also include the game **Magnetic Planet** that is basically the same game as Q-Pop but with different graphics and slightly different game mechanics.

Please keep in mind that this is a hobby project, so it will only be updated every now and then. The goal is to finish the remake by the end of 2020 to celebrate the 25th aniversary of the original game. I would be happy (and, frankly, also a bit surprised) to see pull requests and other constructive input from you! Any translations would also be very welcome! Please have a look at [i18n.js](i18n.js). The set of strings is not yet complete, though.

The licensing is a bit complicated. I did not decide on a license for the code, but it will be an open license. The images and sounds are taken straight from the game and just reformated to a modern format. I managed to contact two of the three original creators of the game (Karl-L. von Wendt and Lars Hammer) and both allowed me to use any game resources for fair and non-profit use. I could not reach the third member of the team, Stefan Beyer, who did the wonderful graphics. Stefan, if you read this, please contact me (qpopÂ¤frunit.de).

I made an own repository for the original graphics here: [github.com/Frunit/qpop-ressourcen](https://github.com/Frunit/qpop-ressourcen)

The current version can be played here: [frunit.de/qpop/play](https://frunit.de/qpop/play). Many things work, but many things don't (yet). There is no sound whatsoever, no animations and the survival part is ... very rudimental.
